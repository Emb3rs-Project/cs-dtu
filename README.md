# Industry Wide Solutions and multi-sectorial applications

This is a repository for the __Task5.2 Industry Wide Solutions and multi-sectorial applications__, which is related to MCDM and NFRS Ontology. MCDM stands for Multi-Criteria Decision Making, and NFRS Ontology stands for Non-Functional Requirements Specification Ontology.

The repository contains two folders: [MCDM](https://github.com/Emb3rs-Project/cs-dtu/tree/main/MCDM) and [NFRS_Ontology](https://github.com/Emb3rs-Project/cs-dtu/tree/main/NFRS_Ontology). The MCDM folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates how to use MCDM methods to rank how to make use of excess heat based on multiple criteria. The NFRS_Ontology folder contains an OWL file that defines an ontology for non-functional requirements specification, and how to use Apache Jena Fuseki Server to work with an ontology that supports the development of industrial energy management systems.

The repository is created by the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The repository is public and open for contributions.
